# Animal Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network
This project aims to classify animals into 5 different classes and One vs rest classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset consists of images of different set of animals. 
* 5-Class.ipynb : 5-class classification <br>
* Ovr-3-fold.ipynb : One vs rest classififcation <br> 
              I have only taken 15 classes of animals for training<br>
* Folders '5 classes of animals' and '15 classes of animals' are the respective image dataset used for building this CNN models 
## Resources used 
1) Kaggle notebooks : Referred notebooks of kaggle master's who implement transfer learning techniquesm like EfficientNetB3.
2) Stackoverflow : Articles related to One vs rest to get the concept clarity and also used to resolve errors in the code.
3) Medium Blogs : Articles to gain practical ways of implementing CNN.
4) Tensorflow and Keras Documentation : Referred it for code syntax and execution.
5) Youtube : Codebasics channel for studying concepts of CNN like padding, stride, Flatten , Dropout etc.
6) ChatGPT : Used for resolving error.

I made a great effort, but I was unable to host my notebook in quarto because of time constraints.<br>
While rendering my notebook to quarto, I was facing a lot of errors.
